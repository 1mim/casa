# CASA
Exclusive Furniture and Home Interior | Online Store

# Introduction
<strong>CASA</strong> – <em>Italian for home</em> – is an exclusive furniture and home interior brand that just opened its very own <strong>online store</strong>. Debuting its first collection, Collection Uno, followers will be able to grab their hands on these exclusive items.

# Backstory
CASA was created as my final capstone project for General Assembly’s SEI31 course. I decided to do an online store as I’ve always wanted to create one. Furniture was chosen so that i could tie in everything as a whole concept brand. 

For this project I decided to use the <strong>MERN</strong> Stack (<em>Mongo, Express, React, Nodejs</em>) and choose to fully focus on the frontend development. Which included learning how to use <strong>Redux</strong>, experimenting with <strong>CSS</strong> as well as venture into the realm of animation with <strong>GSAP</strong>.
